## Overview
### Description
AniMe is a social networking app to share, discover, and interact with members of the anime watching community.


### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** This app would be developed for mobile applications, but can be scaled up to a web application.
- **Story:** Profile can display favorite anime shows, following/followers count, and a currently watching list. Home screen would show followed users comments/thoughts on an anime and animes that one is following. Discovery screen displaying collection view of anime.
- **Market:** Any individual with a pre-existing or burgeoning interest in anime. There is no niche market, as the app will be accessible for any age group; however, there will be an age requirement for online safety.
- **Habit:** This app can be used as much as the user wants to keep friends and themselves updated on the animes they're following. Users would use this app less than more popular social networking apps, but could easily be used on a daily basis.
- **Scope:** The scope of AniMe is well-formed, as it establishes 3 required aspects for social networking/discovery of anime; additionally, there are optional user stories that will improve and add features to the UI. The barebones version of AniMe is still interesting to build, and the app will be technically challenging, but not impossible, to build given the time constraint.
